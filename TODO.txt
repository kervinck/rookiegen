21057207015 perft lines in 351.51 seconds: 59.9 MHz

Estimated time: 9+5
9183421888 * 0.350 / 3600 = 892832 core hours
                          = 9300 cluster hours
                          = 387.5 cluster days

Not good. Need x10 speedup
10+4 will do (~3M)
11+3 might be fastest, but requires the creation of temporary 11-ply files
Alternative: 10+4 with hashing
